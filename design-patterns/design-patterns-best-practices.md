## Pattern Selection Guidelines

### Understand the Problem First

Before choosing a design pattern, thoroughly understand the problem you're trying to solve:

- **Clear Requirements**: Ensure you have a clear understanding of the functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Current vs. Future Needs**: Consider both immediate needs and likely future requirements.
- **Constraints**: Understand technical constraints, performance requirements, and scalability needs.

### Selection Criteria

When selecting a pattern, consider:

1. **Primary Intent**: Does the pattern's primary purpose align with your problem?
2. **Applicability**: Do your problem characteristics match the pattern's applicability criteria?
3. **Consequences**: Are the trade-offs introduced by the pattern acceptable?
4. **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest solution to your problem?
5. **Team Familiarity**: Is your team familiar with the pattern or can they quickly learn it?

### Common Selection Mistakes

- **Pattern Overuse**: Using patterns when simpler solutions would suffice
- **Force-fitting**: Trying to make a problem fit a pattern rather than vice versa
- **Premature Abstraction**: Applying patterns before understanding the real problem
- **Resume-Driven Development**: Using patterns to show off rather than solve problems

## Implementation Best Practices

### Follow SOLID Principles

Design patterns should reinforce, not replace, solid engineering principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have a single reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Context Awareness

- **Adapt to the Codebase**: Implement patterns in a way that fits the existing codebase style
- **Consider Language Features**: Use language-specific features to improve pattern implementation
- **Framework Integration**: Ensure patterns work well with frameworks in use

### Naming Conventions

- **Clear Pattern Indication**: Name classes to indicate the pattern being used (e.g., UserFactory, OrderBuilder)
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use consistent naming across the codebase for similar pattern implementations
- **Self-Documenting**: Names should reflect roles in the pattern

### Implementation Examples - Do's and Don'ts

**Singleton Pattern - Do:**
```java
public enum Singleton {
    INSTANCE;
    
    public void doSomething() {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

**Singleton Pattern - Don't:**
```java
public class BadSingleton {
    private static BadSingleton instance;
    
    private BadSingleton() {}
    
    public static BadSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new BadSingleton(); // Not thread-safe
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## Combining Design Patterns

Design patterns are often more powerful when combined. Common effective combinations include:

### MVC + Observer

The Model-View-Controller pattern often uses the Observer pattern to notify Views of Model changes:

```java
// Model implements Observable (or uses PropertyChangeSupport)
// Views implement Observer
// Controller updates Model, which notifies Views
```

### Factory Method + Strategy

Use Factory Method to create Strategy implementations:

```java
public class PaymentProcessorFactory {
    public PaymentStrategy createPaymentStrategy(String type) {
        if ("credit".equals(type)) {
            return new CreditCardPaymentStrategy();
        } else if ("paypal".equals(type)) {
            return new PayPalPaymentStrategy();
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown payment type");
    }
}
```

### Decorator + Composite

Use Decorator to add behavior to Composite structures:

```java
// Base component interface
Component component = new ConcreteComponent();
// Add decorators
component = new SecurityDecorator(component);
component = new LoggingDecorator(component);
// Use in composite structure
CompositeComponent composite = new CompositeComponent();
composite.add(component);
```

### Additional Effective Combinations

- **Builder + Factory Method**: Factory Method creates Builders for complex objects
- **Adapter + Facade**: Facade uses Adapters to integrate different subsystems
- **Chain of Responsibility + Command**: Commands travel through a processing chain
- **Proxy + Decorator**: Proxy controls access, Decorator adds behavior

## Refactoring to Patterns

### Recognizing Pattern Opportunities

Look for these code smells that often indicate opportunities for patterns:

- **Duplicate Code**: May indicate need for Template Method or Strategy
- **Large Switch Statements**: Often replaceable with Strategy or Command
- **High Coupling**: May benefit from Observer or Mediator
- **Complex Object Creation**: Consider Factory, Builder, or Prototype
- **Feature Envy**: May indicate need for moving behavior via Command or Strategy

### Refactoring Steps

1. **Identify the Problem**: Determine what specific issue needs addressing
2. **Select Candidate Pattern**: Choose pattern(s) that might solve the problem
3. **Test Understanding**: Ensure you understand how the pattern addresses the issue
4. **Create Tests**: Write tests to verify current behavior
5. **Refactor Incrementally**: Apply the pattern in small, testable steps
6. **Verify with Tests**: Ensure all tests pass after each step
7. **Review**: Assess if the pattern solved the original problem

### Example: Refactoring to Strategy Pattern

**Before:**
```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(String type, double amount) {
        if ("credit".equals(type)) {
            // Credit card processing logic
            System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
        } else if ("paypal".equals(type)) {
            // PayPal processing logic
            System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of $" + amount);
        } else if ("crypto".equals(type)) {
            // Cryptocurrency processing logic
            System.out.println("Processing crypto payment of $" + amount);
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```java
// Strategy interface
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    void process(double amount);
}

// Concrete strategies
public class CreditCardStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void process(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

public class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void process(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

public class CryptoStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void process(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing crypto payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

// Context
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentStrategy strategy;
    
    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        if (strategy == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Payment strategy not set");
        }
        strategy.process(amount);
    }
}
```

## Testing Pattern Implementations

### Test-Driven Development

Apply TDD when implementing patterns:

1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Implement pattern to satisfy tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing

### Testing Strategies by Pattern Type

**Creational Patterns**:
- Test that objects are created with correct initial state
- Test that singletons maintain a single instance
- Test that factories create the right type of object

**Structural Patterns**:
- Test that composed objects work correctly together
- Test that adapters correctly translate between interfaces
- Test that proxies correctly control access to objects

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Test that the flow of control works as expected
- Test that objects communicate correctly
- Test that state changes happen appropriately

### Mocking and Isolation

- Use mocks to isolate the pattern being tested
- Test integration with real dependencies in separate tests
- Consider testing frameworks like Mockito for Java

## Performance Considerations

### Pattern Performance Impact

Design patterns can impact performance in various ways:

- **Indirection Cost**: Patterns often add layers of indirection
- **Object Creation**: Some patterns increase the number of objects created
- **Method Calls**: Some patterns increase the number of method calls
- **Memory Usage**: Some patterns increase memory consumption

### Optimization Guidelines

- **Measure First**: Use profiling to identify actual bottlenecks
- **Optimize Hot Spots**: Focus optimization on frequently used code paths
- **Consider Alternatives**: Use simpler patterns when performance is critical
- **Caching**: Add caching to expensive pattern operations
- **Lazy Initialization**: Initialize components only when needed

### Common Performance Issues

**Factory Method vs. Direct Creation**:
- Factory Method adds method call overhead
- Factory Method allows for optimization through caching or object pooling

**Proxy Overhead**:
- Dynamic proxies (like in Spring) can be slower than direct calls
- Consider static proxies for performance-critical code

**Observer Pattern**:
- Large numbers of observers can cause notification bottlenecks
- Consider batch notifications or update throttling

## Documentation Guidelines

### Pattern Documentation

When documenting pattern usage in code:

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Clearly state which pattern is being used
2. **Explain Intent**: Document why the pattern was chosen
3. **Describe Structure**: Outline how classes participate in the pattern
4. **Highlight Variations**: Note any customizations or variations
5. **List Alternatives**: Mention alternatives considered and why they were rejected

### Example Documentation

```java
/**
 * OrderProcessor uses the Strategy pattern to support different processing algorithms.
 * 
 * Intent: Allow the processing algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
 * 
 * Structure:
 * - OrderProcessor: Context class that uses a processing strategy
 * - OrderProcessingStrategy: Strategy interface
 * - BatchOrderStrategy, RealTimeOrderStrategy: Concrete strategies
 * 
 * This implementation allows for easy addition of new processing strategies
 * without modifying the OrderProcessor class.
 * 
 * Alternative considered: Template Method pattern, rejected because we needed
 * to switch strategies at runtime.
 */
public class OrderProcessor {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Modern Alternatives

### Functional Approaches

Modern Java's functional features can replace some traditional patterns:

**Strategy Pattern with Lambdas**:
```java
// Traditional
interface Validator {
    boolean validate(String input);
}

class EmailValidator implements Validator {
    @Override
    public boolean validate(String input) {
        return input.matches("^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$");
    }
}

// Functional
Function<String, Boolean> emailValidator = 
    input -> input.matches("^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$");
```

**Command Pattern with Method References**:
```java
// Traditional
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class SaveCommand implements Command {
    private Document doc;
    public SaveCommand(Document doc) {
        this.doc = doc;
    }
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        doc.save();
    }
}

// Functional
Document doc = new Document();
Runnable saveCommand = doc::save;
```

### Reactive Programming

Reactive programming can replace some traditional patterns:

- **Observer Pattern** → **Reactive Streams** (RxJava, Project Reactor)
- **Iterator Pattern** → **Observable/Flowable Sequences**
- **Chain of Responsibility** → **Operators Chain**

### Dependency Injection Frameworks

Modern DI frameworks reduce the need for certain patterns:

- **Factory Pattern** → **Container-managed instantiation**
- **Singleton Pattern** → **Scoped beans**
- **Service Locator** → **Injection points**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Common Design Anti-patterns

1. **God Object**: Class that knows or does too much
2. **Golden Hammer**: Overusing a familiar pattern for every problem
3. **Object Orgy**: Insufficient encapsulation and excessive object coupling
4. **Spaghetti Code**: Tangled, unstructured code with unclear flow
5. **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before profiling real bottlenecks

### Pattern-Specific Anti-patterns

**Singleton Abuse**:
- Using singletons for simple global state
- Creating too many singletons in an application
- Using singletons to avoid proper dependency management

**Factory Overuse**:
- Creating factories for simple object creation
- Implementing factory hierarchies that are more complex than the objects they create
- Using abstract factories when simple factories would suffice

**Observer Overload**:
- Creating circular observer relationships
- Adding too many observers without consideration for performance
- Using observers where simple method calls would work

## Evolving Patterns

### Adapting Classic Patterns

Classic patterns often need adaptation for modern contexts:

- **Cloud-Native Environments**: Consider elasticity, resilience, and distributed state
- **Microservices Architecture**: Adapt patterns for service boundaries and eventual consistency
- **Container-Based Deployment**: Consider immutability and infrastructure-as-code implications

### Emerging Patterns

New patterns continue to emerge to address modern challenges:

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
2. **Saga**: Manage distributed transactions across microservices
3. **CQRS**: Separate command and query responsibilities
4. **Event Sourcing**: Store state as a sequence of events
5. **Sidecar**: Deploy supporting services alongside primary services

### Staying Current

To stay current with evolving patterns:

- **Follow Industry Thought Leaders**: Read blogs and books from pattern experts
- **Participate in Communities**: Join discussions in programming communities
- **Review Open Source Projects**: Study pattern usage in successful projects
- **Practice Continuous Learning**: Regularly update your pattern knowledge
- **Apply Critical Thinking**: Evaluate patterns based on their actual benefits

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive journey of an API request in a production Kubernetes environment, from the initial client request to response delivery. The architecture follows industry best practices for security, performance, and reliability, implementing a multi-layered approach to protect and efficiently deliver API services.

The document details how requests flow through each architectural component, focusing on security aspects, performance considerations, and potential failure points. It provides infrastructure teams and technical architects with an in-depth understanding of the platform's request handling mechanisms.

## Architecture Components

The key components in our Kubernetes API request flow architecture include:

1. **Client Application**: The source of API requests (mobile app, web application, or third-party service)
2. **Akamai CDN/Edge Protection**: Global content delivery network and edge protection layer
3. **NGINX Ingress Controller**: Kubernetes entry point for external HTTP/HTTPS traffic
4. **Kubernetes Ingress Resources**: Kubernetes objects defining routing rules
5. **Kubernetes Services**: Internal load balancing and service discovery mechanism
6. **Kubernetes Pods**: Running application containers that process requests
7. **Service Backends**: Databases, caches, and other backing services

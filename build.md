# Java Learning Platform Build Plan

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive learning platform for modern Java development technologies, including Java core, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, microservices architectures, and design patterns. The content is organized in a logical directory structure with markdown files for each topic.

## Tech Stack
- **Content Format**: Markdown (.md)
- **Target Audience**: Intermediate developers
- **Content Structure**: Each file follows a consistent 10-section format
- **Coverage**: Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x, Kubernetes, Microservices, Design Patterns

## Directory Structure
```
.
├── java/                   # Core Java concepts
├── spring-boot/            # Spring Boot framework 
├── kubernetes/             # Kubernetes container orchestration
├── microservices/          # Microservice architecture and patterns
└── design-patterns/        # Software design patterns
```

## Content Format
Each markdown file will follow this consistent structure:
1. Title and brief overview
2. Prerequisites (if any)
3. Learning objectives
4. Table of contents
5. Main content with clear explanations and examples
6. Code samples (where applicable)
7. Best practices
8. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
9. Resources for further learning
10. Practice exercises or projects

## Quality Guidelines
- Up-to-date content reflecting modern practices (Java 17+, Spring Boot 3)
- Practical real-world examples
- Code snippets where relevant
- Clear, concise language for intermediate developers
- Text descriptions of diagrams/visuals (for later implementation)
- Integration points between technologies
- Practical implementation focus
- Troubleshooting guidance

## Development Approach
1. Create directory structure
2. Develop content for Java fundamentals
3. Create Spring Boot materials
4. Develop Kubernetes content
5. Create microservices materials
6. Develop design patterns content
7. Review and refine all materials
8. Test content with target audience

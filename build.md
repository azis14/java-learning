# Java Learning Platform - Build Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the overall architecture, technology stack, and build plan for the Java Learning Platform. The platform is designed to be a comprehensive learning resource for Java developers, from beginners to experienced professionals, covering everything from core Java concepts to advanced topics like microservices and Kubernetes.

## Architecture Overview

The Java Learning Platform is built as a static documentation site with the following characteristics:

- **Content-first approach**: Focus on high-quality, well-structured learning materials
- **Responsive design**: Accessible on all devices from desktop to mobile
- **Searchable**: Robust search functionality for easy topic discovery
- **Extensible**: Modular structure to easily add new content sections
- **Version controlled**: All content maintained in Git for tracking changes

## Technology Stack

### Documentation Framework

- **Primary Framework**: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- **Markdown Extensions**: 
  - [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/) for advanced Markdown features
  - [MkDocs Macros](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/) for content reuse

### Search Implementation

- **MkDocs-Search**: Built-in search functionality
- **Lunr.js**: JavaScript search engine for client-side search

### Code Examples & Interactive Elements

- **Code Highlighting**: [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting
- **Interactive Diagrams**: [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) for sequence and flow diagrams
- **Embedded Sandboxes**: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) embeds for interactive examples

### Deployment & Hosting

- **Build System**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Custom Domain**: Configured with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt
- **CDN**: Cloudflare for global distribution and caching

## Build & Development Process

### Local Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - pip
   - git

2. **Setup Instructions**:
   ```bash
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourorganization/java-learning.git
   cd java-learning
   
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Start local development server
   mkdocs serve
   ```

3. **File Structure**:
   ```
   java-learning/
   ├── docs/
   │   ├── index.md                # Home page
   │   ├── java/                   # Java core topics
   │   ├── spring-boot/            # Spring Boot documentation
   │   ├── microservices/          # Microservices architecture
   │   ├── kubernetes/             # Kubernetes documentation
   │   ├── design-patterns/        # Design patterns
   │   └── assets/                 # Images, diagrams, etc.
   ├── examples/                   # Code examples by section
   ├── mkdocs.yml                  # MkDocs configuration
   ├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
   └── README.md                   # Project overview
   ```

### Content Development Guidelines

1. **Style Guide**:
   - Use consistent Markdown formatting
   - H1 (#) for page titles only
   - H2 (##) for major sections
   - H3-H6 for subsections as needed
   - Code blocks with language specification
   - Screenshots with alt text for accessibility

2. **Content Structure**:
   - Start each document with a clear introduction
   - Include a table of contents for longer documents
   - Provide real-world examples
   - End with references and further reading
   - Use consistent terminology throughout

3. **Review Process**:
   - Technical accuracy review
   - Language and clarity review
   - Code examples testing
   - Link verification

### Build & Deployment Workflow

1. **Development**:
   - Create content in feature branches
   - Test locally using `mkdocs serve`
   - Submit pull requests for review

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Automated checks on pull requests:
     - Markdown linting
     - Link checking
     - Build validation

3. **Deployment**:
   - Automatic deployment to staging environment for PRs
   - Manual approval for production deployment
   - Production build via GitHub Actions
   - Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Duration | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Initial setup and framework configuration | 1 week | Complete |
| 2 | Core Java documentation | 4 weeks | Complete |
| 3 | Spring Boot documentation | 4 weeks | Complete |
